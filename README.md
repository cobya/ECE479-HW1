# ECE479 Homework #1

This project will take in an input of two water jugs that have initial conditions and a goal state and figure out a way to reach the goal state from the initial state using two different methods. The first of these methods is entirely random operations between the two water jugs to demonstrate the unlikelyness of finding a solution with that method. The second will search the possible outcomes by using Depth First Search to find the goal state and the path to that state.
